Why blog ?
-------------------------

The effort behind this site started in 2013 when Vijay first interviewed with Red Hat. He was then advised by a wise gentleman to start contributing to the community. The only means Vijay could think of at that time, being a JBoss EAP Administrator, was to start with posts reflecting the consulting experiences with EAP. While the migration is still in the works, the old blog can still be found [here](http://everything-jboss.blogspot.com).

The goal of this blog is to continue/extend on the legacy, share the experiences and lessons learnt with others who could benefit from them.
